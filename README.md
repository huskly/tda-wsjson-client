# thinkorswim WsJson API client

This is a node and browser API client for the (undocumented) thinkorswim WebSocket API.

🚧 Work in progress 🚧

# Prerequisites

- Node 18+

# Building for Node

```
yarn install
yarn build
```

# Running the test app

Create a `.env` file with the following:

```
NODE_ENV=development
DEBUG=*
DEBUG_DEPTH=5
# either the following
TOS_ACCESS_TOKEN=<access_token>
TOS_REFRESH_TOKEN=<refresh_token>
# or the following
# if you don't have an access token and refresh token, you can use your username and password
# this will launch a browser to authenticate and then save the access token and refresh token
to the .env.development file.
TOS_USERNAME=<username>
TOS_PASSWORD=<password>
```

```
node --env-file=.env dist/example/testApp.js
```

## Running the proxy server

```
node --env-file=.env dist/example/wsProxyServer.js
```

## Running the proxy client

```
node dist/example/wsProxyClient.js
> authenticateWithAccessToken {"accessToken":"<auth_token>","refreshToken":"<refresh_token>"}
> quotes ["ABNB", "UBER"]
> accountPositions "1234567890"
```

## Authentication flow

There seems to be currently two ways to authenticate:

1. From scratch with username and password:

   1.1 Send a message with the `login/schwab` service including the `authCode` obtained from the browser oauth flow at `trade.thinkorswim.com`;

   1.2 This will return a `token` and `refreshToken` which should be saved for future use;

   1.3. The `authCode` is single use and cannot be used again once exchanged for a token.

2. From a previously obtained `token`

   2.1 Send a message with the `login` service including the `token` returned from the `login/schwab` response message (step 1 above)

   2.2 This will return the same `token`, weirdly, and a `refreshToken`, which should be saved for future use

   2.3 The token is valid for 24 hours.
